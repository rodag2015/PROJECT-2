        <strong>"Masterpiece
            Elden Ring is a massive iteration on what FromSoftware began with the Souls series, bringing its relentlessly challenging combat to an incredible open world that gives us the freedom to choose our own path." - Mitchell Saltzman</strong>

          <strong>"Probably one of the best games FromSoftware has made, it plays like Sekiro and Dark Souls 3 mixed together.  With the open world elements of the legend of Zelda breath of the wild.  The boss fights and some of the tougher enemies seem daunting at first but the open world helps by just letting you go somewhere else and level grind, craft items, and find items to help you go back and defeat the enemy you had a problem with.  It is also very easy and convenient that you can summon different creatures to help you in tough spots even if your not playing as a mage character.  You can also summon friends or randoms pretty much wherever you want.  The map on this game is massive I am 33 hours in and I have only discovered a fraction of the things there are to do in this game.  You also get a horse/goat mount early in the game named torrent which makes traveling and boss fights a lot easier.  So in close my review might be a tab biased because I already love dark souls but I am dumbfounded by this game, itâ€™s fantastic, beautiful, runs well (I have a ps5), controls/combat feels right and tight, thousands of things to do, and an amazing world/story.  If you have respect for game developers actually taking time and really putting love into their franchise this game is worth every penny."-Jacob Foreman</strong>

          <strong>"I'm a huge fan of Fromsoft and was beyond hyped for Elden Ring. Fortunately, this game lived up to the hype as it successfully evolved not only the Souls formula but the open world of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. The open world in this game is close to perfection in my opinion as it is not made up of FOMO style content but genuinely worthwhile sights, quests, and thrills that can be indulged in by the player at whatever pace or manner they want. Furthermore, it improves upon BOTW's world by having multiple handcrafted dungeons that greatly vary in scale, design, and necessity (i.e., the majority are optional) but are all uniformly excellent as a result of some truly incredible level and enemy design. In typical Fromsoft fashion, the combat is also fantastic with lots of depth and satisfying mechanics to play around with. The excellent combat is further complimented by great build variety with many cool weapons, magic, incantations, and ashes of war to try out. My only complaint would be that the boss fights are a bit of a mixed bag with a select few matching From's best, many being quite middling, and some being incredibly unpleasant especially during the late game. However, this is a minor complaint because Elden Ring is a triumph of game design and the rare case where a game manages to cement itself as an instant classic."-Ryan Lyster</strong>

        <strong>"Elden Rings is definitely a love it or hate it kind of game for most gamers others are like me who are more "Meh". Meaning there are definite aspects that I think are great and others which are annoying to at time angrily frustrating until you overcome and win then it's beyond gratifying. The game definitely doesn't hold your hand but neither does it overly punish you either like with these types of games you just have to be patient and build your character up. Like with its sibling game Blood Borne and Demon Souls Elden Rings is for the most part an exploration jrpg meaning you don't have to rush to the finish line but are meant to explore and toughen up to where a gigantic spider or wolf won't kill you with a swipe.
The graphics at times are very beautiful and at others pretty dreary and bleak but again it's a tone the game is going for.Meaning you'll see lush vibrant landscapes that will thrill any Tolkien fan to a land barren and looks like the first circle of hell. The combat is simplistic but does take a little getting used to and remember you don't have to fight every living thing you see in the world. Is this game for everyone? obviously not if you played demon souls or a similar game and liked it then yeah you'll enjoy this game but if you didn't or didn't care to try it out then this game obviously won't be for you."-Ric Sw</strong>

          <strong>"First off, 5 stars right out of the gate the introduction and entirety of the game is fantastic, however there are many repetitious bosses and my hatred for the godskin duo. I really don't like the addition of spirit ashes because it makes the game way too easy and I feel like some new players wouldn't get the true souls experience of suffering on a boss only to beat it, sure you can change your difficulty but when I used summons I was left with this weird feeling of guilt and I did something wrong. Replayability is  fantastic however except once you realize what places are worth your time and not worth your time you skim over that part of the game quickly. But back to positive things, I love that enemies delay their attacks which make them seem so much more intelligent and alive, I love the idea of a normal guy going up against a literal god instead of being the cliche "chosen one" who was born powerful rather than becoming powerful through your decisions and actions, in other words it feels fantastic. 4.6/5"-Magic Oddball</strong>

          <strong>"Overall I think Elden Ring is great. As a first timer in the dark souls genre which I was always a fan of, it certainly did not disappoint. The exploration is fantastic, most of the combat is great, the boss fights are also amazing. However, because I'm on pc, some of the controls(especially skills which I believe is L2 on PS) requires two keys to be pressed, both of them do something different. Lots of times I will just get two unwanted actions instead of using my skills, which, because of my glass cannon build, will just get me killed. This happens especially frequently in boss fights which could be very irritating as you are pressing the right buttons even at correct timings. But other than that, I had a tremendous amount of fun playing this game, would recommend if you are on PS. If you are on PC, try to hook up a controller to your computer as it would make your life a bit easier."-Jonathan Miller</strong>

          <strong>"There are some neat moments.   The player control feels very, very smooth.  The weapon unique move sets are a very interesting way they have given the player more capability to confront their challenges.   The less flattering:  they made an enormous game and only justified about 20% of the space it takes up.   The "legacy" dungeons are great,  but the exploration that you must go through in between these areas (the overworld) is very tedious and it feels like each overworld area is large for the purpose of justifying the horse you can ride,  but the horse seems to exist just to make the large areas manageable.  From Software tried a new approach and I really hope they realize that their strengths are interwoven level design and quality boss challenge.  The game is 80% filler in terms of map saturation and seems like out of the 100ish boss encounters,  maybe 10 of them are unique (not kidding,  even some of the "great bosses" end up at the end of the cookie cutter caves and dungeons a 2nd and 3rd time).  Some people will certainly like this aspect of the game,  there is a lot of stuff to plow through and if you get excited about having higher weapon scaling numbers (yes standard weapons can go up to +25 now...but the enemy health also goes through the roof,  so it is just keeping up with numbers, not allowing you to be extra OP.), lots of bosses to say you beat (and you prefer quantity over quality), then you'll likely dig this.  To me,  they bit off more than they could chew and it feels a lot like dark souls 2 (tons of bosses, a handful are memorable)"-Travis Hyde</strong>

          <strong>"Haven't played any FromSoftware games before but Elden Ring is really fun! The gameplay is incredibly addicting and while some open world enemies aren't too difficult to beat, the open world bosses/dungeon bosses are no joke but it's extremely rewarding once you do beat them.

I don't play games for graphics so if your one of those ppl then you prob don't like elden ring and youre missing out on alot of other amazing games. 

The world is absolutely ginormous and there are so many secrets to explore. It's like Skyrim on steroids, I can see myself putting in 150+ hr's easily and still not find everything. 

My only complaint is that make the story so hard to figure out.i mean absolutely no direction or hint as to what you need or want to do.  I'm not asking for my hand to held through it but atleast give me a journal like they did in Kingdom Come to write notes down about ppl I meet and what we talked about. This is really a huge problem because without a story or even a direction to go I feel like I'm just wandering around with no purpose killing stuff"-Angelo Russo</strong>

          <strong>"Game is very fun with some minor flaws. Let me just say I have 20+ hrs in the game and from what I found exploring  most of the caves have the same layout and loots hardly exciting and the boss loot is diaspointing and a retutn to entrace portal opens up is about it. Why detour when all that glowing item in that strange ruins is just a thing you'll never use also so many areas are 1 hit kills so you will find yourself running through towns grabbing loot. I have noticed they tweaked the dif alittle (I have soloed a few bosses, some bother me alot.) Some of the hardest ones are bosses you need to kill to progress the optional ones are easier. I kind of think it should be the other way around, like what if I just wanna finish the game and enjoy the art? After siekiro I decided no more from software but i love the art style so much that i bought in. From software delivered a fine fantasy experience as expected regardless of the flaws though. I just think, and don't come after me git gud crowd, they can add a story mode perhaps, I can't relax every mob is torture. There is a line between lazy difficulty (i.e 1 hit kills and so on) and a game that's equally challenging and enjoyable. Still amazing and will continue to torture myself with."-MATT Strange</strong>

        <strong>"Heres all the problems I have with this "Soulsborne" game. No matter what enemy I fight they will stagger out of attacks 100% of the f##king time, doesn't matter if it's an actual enemy or a rotting corpse with a broken stick against, I mean a 40 poise armor set shouldn't me staggered by an enemy with the strength of my dying grandmother. Hit response also gives me brain damage I literally lost 40k runes because our attacks hit "at the same time" even though mine was really the first because my weapons attack speed was literally twice as fast. Literally killed me when he died. And on the way to retrieve my runes I got grab locked and one shot. Yeah remember when dark souls used to get you with an attack you can't avoid it sucked but it left you with a chance to recover, nope not a thing in this game apparently. someone at FS Replay the first two games and use some references there to instead of just ripping mechanics from DS3 and Sekiro and dropkicking it out.

I really want to like this game but the amount of time I dye fairly to the amount of time I die to random B's is like 2/10"-El Depe</strong>

          <strong>"First time playing a From Software game.  The person who sold me it told me I could bring it back within a week with no questions asked because a lot of people didn't like it, and I can see why.

The game itself is beautiful.  I like the variety of landscapes in the huge open world, and there are endless possibilities to the character you create.  Some of the boss fights are really cool and visually impressive.

The story is really lacking, and there are so few clues to how the game is supposed to progress I had to rely on Google to tell me what the hell was going on.  I got so frustrated dying over and over again to the same bosses I resorted to a rune farming exploit to level my character up to a point where I wasn't getting one-shotted all the time, and even then there are enemies with relentless movesets that it's a crapshoot you will survive.  This kind of repetitive game play, in the sense that if you die you have to re-do the same sequence over and over again for the chance to survive whatever garbage way you died before, is really not fun.  I hate that I had to spend hours just leveling up my character so I wouldn't die constantly, and all I really do is spam one weapon art notorious for being overpowered to advance in the game.

I am going to finish the game completely out of spite, then remove this game from my console and never play another From Software game again.  2 stars just because it's pretty, otherwise it's a great way to grow grey hairs and risk an aneurysm."-Jody Ward</strong>

          <strong>"As for the first time playing souls games, the game itself is pretty decent and fun to play. My issue with this game is the controls and when taking a hit vs enemies. 

The dodge command listens on the release and not on press, meaning when you release your thumb off the "o" button in ps the character dodges. which makes the character response way slower and this programming feature really sucks and slobby.

The other terrible thing while playing against enemies you may keep hitting them and they still do their damage and hit while when you get hit you lay in the ground forever and when you about to get up another blow comes to kill you. Too slow graphics for recovery. 

If this is software's way of making the game hard well it sucks. My rating here is after playing 246 hours of the game so I gave it pretty decent time to judge and yes I enjoy the game but these aspects makes the game less than average because we are in the era of digital and high processors and not ancient ones where I give the command and shall wait until the processor processes this command"-Ahmed Farghaly</strong>

        <strong>"Not sure why this game got as much hype as it did. Itâ€™s literally plagued with all the same problems as every previous entry. Hit registration is horrible. Constantly dying because attacks just go through enemies, attacks always clipping the wall even if your not right up on it and yet enemies will stand on the other side of a door as you and just keep attack spamming and hitting you through the wall. The button inputs are horrible they are like 3 steps behind youâ€™ll be trying to dodge and your character will just keep attacking even though your not even hitting attack anymore. Or the game will spam roll and cause you to not be able to time your attacks. Not to mention 90% of the dodge rolls in the game you still get hit. The hit boxes on the player models are all jacked up it seems. Youâ€™ll be completely behind the npc while theyâ€™re attacking and still get hit. The difficulty seems to be RNG really. Iâ€™ll run into a regular npc and itâ€™ll seem like Iâ€™m having a harder time fighting the regular npc than I did a boss. 14 tries to kill one dog in the field in Stormveil castle but it took me 6 tries to beat Margit before I even decided to go to the round table. I can go toe to toe and use one flasks on one of the roaming knights but man let me feel you those birds with knives for feet are near impossible to beat. And it seems like you guys made it near impossible to try to skip enemies to speed run back to your tunes. Which leads you to fight almost every single one of them and then by the time your back your either in the same situation or worse because of the RNG of the npcs. You donâ€™t know if your gonna be running into Rambo next or Winnie the Pooh. Then you have your npc invaders who ignore the formalities of being a player like, theyâ€™re spellcastong times are always different. Sometimes mad tongue will take 3 seconds to cast his shards and other times you go to run up on him and heâ€™ll hit you with one when your in his face with no cast animation. Apparently your supposed to gain flasks as well by doing certain things like clearing groups of enemies. Which worked in the open world but as soon as it seemed like I went into a dungeon the mechanic would stop working. Clear groups upon groups of mobs and donâ€™t receive anything. They give you very to little runes from each enemy so it takes forever to even level your character up. And then to add to that they have a bunch of items to collect around the world THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY USELESS TO YOU but you canâ€™t find a set a gear without buying it from a merchant in early game. Possibly the worst entry in the series."-Charles Littler</strong>

          <strong>"Gameplay 1/5 - Feels slow and clunky, same slow and ridiculous combat animations as other souls games. The combat feels so bad and braindead, without much skill or mechanics, that I find myself just avoiding most of the low-medium tier enemies, most of which arent worth many runes anyway. The grind for levels or upgrade materials feels obnoxious. Feels exactly like dark souls re-skinned.
The horse vs horse combat feels the most fun. 
The world feels a little empty to the point of boredom, but exploration is still fun at times. Bosses are often just recycled. Its not strange to fight the same boss +/- 4 times
I like the lack of "go here do that" that alot of open world games have, feels more immersive that way. 
Despite not enjoying the game all that much, I feel compelled to keep coming back, like theyve gotten advice from a psychologist on how to addict people. 

Sound - 1/5
Pretty boring and generic soundtrack. Sounds just like other souls games and not very good even disregarding that. 
Re-used sounds all the way from dark souls 1 it seems like. 

Graphics - 2/5
60 fps is nice when it's not having random hiccups and frame drops
Would look impressive if it were 7 years ago, but now is just average.
Environment textures look lazily done.

Story/Theme - 1/5
I like the theme much better than both souls and bloodborne, but it feels a little hodgepodged, breaking immersion once again. Was hoping for something firmly pre-medieval rather than a mashup of the iron age all the way to the renaissance. 
Story is really vague, despite trying to track down ever NPC and piece of lore I can. Feels lazily written. 
We do have some cute girl NPCs but interaction despite a debuff hug is pretty minimal. NPC interaction in general feels better than the other souls games, but still too sparse.
The weapons and armor can be silly to the point of immersion-breaking

Coding/Technical - 1/5
Enemy AI is terrible. Way too easy and dumb.
Glitches are frequent and game-breaking at times. Have fallen through the map on flat ground, had the game crash during boss fights, multiplayer disconnects all the time. 
Engine seems old and clunky. 
Lack of actual damage calculation on traps, i.e. a stationary spike roller trap still kills if you accidentally just touch it"-joocy muscle</strong>

          <strong>"Although I was hopeful at first, I am highly disappointed. This is, by far, one of the worst rpg games I have ever played and I have played them all. From Drakkhen to Diablo or from WOW to Skyrim, I mean first of all, are we wearing armor in this game? Whats the point of being a tank class, or a paladin If you get 2, or 3 shot on a boss vs being 1 or 2 shot as a mage. At least as a mage you can roll out of the way, tanks are encumbered by a fat roll leaving you to stand and fight which of course you cant because your armor is little better than cloth. At least with cloth you can roll out of the way. A tank is supposed to be able to take high damage and deal low to moderate damage (depending on the weapon). While a mage cant take damage well but deals high damage. Here we have extremely broken rpg values because Armor class and dps simply doesnt make sense. I mean, why have arnor at all when we can just run around naked, dodge roll and dps at range with a 100 physical damage negation shield. This game is very unbalanced and off pace with almost every rpg game that was fun that I have ever played. The game is simply not fun. Classes, make no sense, and have no discernable advantageous difference between them yet, they are very different in disadvantages(i.e. advantageous toward cloth/dps build vs Tank, Paladin or any heavy armor build being disadvantageous). Well, looks like I will be playing World of Warcraft for my rpg gaming needs because this game is a complete waste of time and money. I'm out."-Derrick Mccawley</strong>
